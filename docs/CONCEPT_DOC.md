[Concept document in Figma](https://www.figma.com/board/NUDOLczDf06cQ4UvNTrl6z/nine-lives-CONCEPT-DOC?node-id=4-98&t=FA3wUypeiXl4MnHF-0)

**Working title**: Nine lives (9 lives)

**Concept statement**: 9 lives is 2D game about cat rescuing his owner from afterworld. The player should talk to dead people, solve puzzles and go through *9 levels* (aka 9 doors to the deeper level).

**Genre**: dungeon crawler, puzzle, ~horror~

**Target audience**: 25+ people, interested in old-fashioned games like Zelda or Kirby with no direct narrative and deep, dark atmosphere.

**Unique Selling Points**: Unlike most current games, 9 lives doesn't have any fighting mechanics. As the main character is a cat from the start cat can't actually understand what people are saying, so decisions of the player will influence how he understands the story in the end

## Player Experience and Game POV
The player is a black and white cat living in the current time somewhere in the big city. His owner died. They were very close and treat each others as friends. One day when cat visited his best friend's grave, he found out that he can go down to the afterworld. He doesn't know that this adventure will bring to him, but he thinks he has nothing to lose.

From this time the player will face 9 levels of the afterworld. Each level has its own theme. Each level is populated with different people, animals that not so long ago became dead. The player can try to speak with them, sometimes they will answer, sometimes they are talking to themselves without noticing you. Every peace of information will help the player to pass the entrance to the next level. Some people will be very frightening and will try to harm the cat. The player should find clever ways to avoid all of that. As a peaceful cat he can't enter into direct confrontation and are forced to use the environment for protection.

After every level the cat will become weaker and weaker.<u>At the end the owner will be found and the player will have a chance to choose to save him or go back on the surface</u>. By saving the owner cat became dead
